# DIG
DIG is short for Data Integrity Gardener. It is an OSM tool for keeping track of changes made to data.

OpenStreetMap is the open-source map of the world. Oftentimes, the changes made to data in the map are unnoticed by those that tend to it. This arises from the absence of a convenient way to monitor these changes. This tool is designed to make it more convenient to be up to date as to one's contributions.

This tool runs in python, (originally developed in Jupyter notebook), and notifies OSM users of changes made to their edits. The current state of the project is as an available for download script. Help is requested and desired for improving the output of the program. It is intended to make the tool available online and that is what I am currently working towards. Feel free to reach out and say hi.
