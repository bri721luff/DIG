# DIG
DIG is short for Data Integrity Gardener. It is an OSM tool for keeping track of changes made to data.
OpenStreetMap is the open-source map of the world. Oftentimes, the changes made to data in the map are unnoticed by those that tend to it. This tool is designed to make it more convenient to be up to date as to one's contributions. The notifications it provides on an ongoing basis make it easy to spot trends in how one's contributions are handled once they have been made. 

This tool runs in python, (originally developed in Jupyter notebook), and notifies OSM users of changes made to their edits. The output of the program is a csv report that can then be reformatted as desired. The reports feature the type of object, the objectID, and the time the userID associated with the edit was submitted. There is also a weblink to take the editor to the feature on the OSM platform. From there, it can be easily identified and reviewed.

The current state of the project is as a script available for download. Help is welcomed for improving the output of the program and the quickness of further releases. It is intended to make the tool available online. The currently progress towards that goal is forthcoming. If you have ideas or suggestions for improvement, feel free to reach out and say hi.
